EOQ Mission Control Simulator

Overview

This project is an interactive browser-based simulation of an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) inventory system. It allows users to experiment with inventory parameters and observe, in real time, how decisions affect stock levels, costs, and profit.

The simulator combines operations management logic with dynamic visualization to demonstrate how inventory systems behave over time.

Features

* Real time inventory simulation
* Visualization of stock levels and reorder point (ROP)
* Tracking of revenue, total cost, and net profit
* Holding cost accumulation over time
* Lost sales tracking when inventory is depleted
* Manual ordering and automatic reorder policy
* Lead time with animated shipment arrivals
* Adjustable simulation speed

---

Model Description

The system simulates a continuous review inventory model with the following components:

* Demand (D): constant demand rate per unit time
* Order Quantity (Q): size of each replenishment
* Lead Time (L): delay between placing and receiving an order
* Setup Cost (K): fixed cost per order
* Unit Purchasing Price (P): cost per unit ordered
* Holding Cost (h): cost per unit held per unit time
* Selling Price: revenue per unit sold

---

Inventory Dynamics

At each time step:

* Inventory decreases based on demand
* If inventory reaches zero, unmet demand is counted as lost sales
* Holding cost accumulates based on the current inventory level
* Revenue accumulates based on fulfilled demand

---

Replenishment

* Orders are placed manually or automatically
* Each order arrives after the specified lead time
* Upon arrival, inventory is increased by Q

---

Reorder Policy

* Automatic ordering is triggered when inventory falls below a threshold
* The simulation visualizes the reorder point (ROP) over time

---

Outputs and Visualization

The simulation displays:

* Inventory level over time
* Reorder point (ROP)
* Procurement (ordering) costs
* Holding costs
* Lost sales (cumulative)
* Total revenue
* Total cost
* Net profit

All outputs are updated in real time using interactive charts.

How to Run

1. Open the EOQ.html file in any web browser
2. Set the input parameters (demand, costs, lead time, etc.)
3. Click "Launch Mission"

Then use:

* Place an order for manual control
* Auto-Order to enable automatic replenishment
* Pause/Resume to control simulation
* Reset to restart

---

Purpose

This project was developed as an interactive tool to:

* Illustrate EOQ and inventory control concepts
* Support teaching and experimentation in operations management
* Demonstrate how business models can be implemented as real-time computational systems
